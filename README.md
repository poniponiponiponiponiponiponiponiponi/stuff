# stuff
Random stuff and solutions for ctfs, book exercises, other
competitions and whatever else I'm participating in. Mostly done for
archiving purposes so I have an easily accessible place when I want to
look at my past stuff, for example when I want to reuse part of a
solution. In the future I will probably also put there just ad hoc
scripts and other /dev/urandom kind of stuff.
